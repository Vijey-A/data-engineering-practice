# 1. Basic variable assignment (direct mapping):




# eg:1 -> mapping variable z to the value 93
z = 93
print("z: ", z)

# mapping variable name to the string "Vijey"
name = "Vijey"
print("Name: ", name)




# eg: 2 -> Counting the number of records

raw_data = ["record1", "record2", "record3", "record4"]

# assigning the count of records to variable
record_count = len(raw_data)

print(f"Total records: {record_count}")
